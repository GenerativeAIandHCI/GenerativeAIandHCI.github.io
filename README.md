# Outline

Generative AI and HCI is a Workshop as part of [CHI 2023](https://chi2023.acm.org)

- **Venue**: Online
- **Workshop Date**: 28 April 2023
- **Submission Deadline**: 16 February 2023
- **Notification**: 9 March 2023
- **Submission Website**: TBA
- **Submission Templates**: [ACM Template](https://chi2023.acm.org/for-authors/presenting/papers/chi-publication-formats/) (4 pages max excluding references - Anonymous submissions preferred, but not required.)

In the past year, we have seen or made powerful tools that can create images from textual descriptions or conduct
reasonably conherent conversations, make writing suggestions for creative writers, and write code as a pair
programmer. We have also seen claims of what an historical person “really looked like," and of a “completed”
version of a musical compositions left unfinished by their composer’s untimely death. What all of these examples
have in common is that the AI does not simply categorize data and interpret text as determined by models, but instead
creates something new—e.g., in images, molecules, or designs. This work moves the potential of AI
systems from problem solving to problem finding, and it tends to change the “role” of the AI from decision-maker to human-supporter. Following a successful CHI workshop in 2022, we focus on various aspects of generative AI and its interactions with humans, including

- new sociotechnical opportunities for work and recreation that are afforded by powerful new interactive capabili-
ties
- novel design challenges of systems that produce a different outcome after each invocation
- ethical issues related to their design and use; and
- useful patterns for collaboration between humans and generative AI in different domains

Generative AI can be defined as an AI system that uses existing media to create new, plausible media.
This scope is broad, and the generative potential of AI systems varies greatly. Over the last decade, we have seen
a shift in methodology moving from expert systems based on patterns and heavy human curating towards stochastic and generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that use big data to produce
convincingly human-like results in various domains, and Large Language Models (LLMs) that can generate text, source code, and images from simple instructions (“prompts”).

# Topics and Themes

Our workshop is open to diverse interpretations of interactive generative AI, characterized by the AI systems’ abilities
to make new things, learn new things and foster serendipity and emergence. We are interested in several dimensions of
generative AI, including mixed initiative, human–computer collaboration, or human–computer competition, with the
main focus on interaction between humans and generative AI agents. We welcome researchers from various disciplines,
inviting researchers from different creative domains including, but not limited to art, images, music, text, style transfer,
text-to-image, programming, architecture, design, fashion and movement.
Because of the far-reaching implications of Generative AI, we propose the following list of non-exhaustive, thematic
questions to guide our discussions at the workshop:

- What is generative AI and how can we leverage diverse definitions of it? Does generative AI go beyond intelligent
interaction? What distinguishes generative AI?
- How do you design in this characteristically uncertain space? What design patterns do we need to think about?
How does uncertainty play into this and how to we help people set expectations to designing with AI?
- Do generative AI algorithms contribute needed serendipity to the design process—or simply randomness—or
worse, chaos?
- Is presenting AI as a desirable and “objective” method appropriate for generative AI?

We encourage people to write and answer their own questions as well. We hope that the workshop leads to new
ways-of-thinking.

These themes can be addressed within the following topics:

- The emerging capabilities of generative AI.
- Generative AI existence in different domains including (but not limited to) images, music, text, design, and
motion.
- The role of generative AI in assisting, replacing, and regimenting human work.
- Human-AI collaboration and co-creative systems.
- Ethical issues including misuses and abuses, provenance, copyright, bias, and diversity.
- The uncanny valley in Human-AI interactions.
- Speculative futures of generative AI and its implications for human-AI utopias and dystopias.

As above, we encourage people to add new topics and domains.

# Call for Participation

Generative AI can be defined as an AI system that uses existing media to create new, plausible media. This scope is broad, and the generative potential of AI systems varies greatly. Over the last decade, we have seen a shift in methodology, moving from expert systems based on patterns and heavy human curating towards stochastic and generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that use big data to produce convincingly human-like results in various domains.

This workshop applies human centered themes to a new and powerful technology, generative artificial intelligence (AI). Unlike AI systems that produce decisions or descriptions, generative AI systems produce new instances of types of data that can include images, texts, music, design, and motion. The results are often similar to results produced by humans.

However, it is not yet clear how humans can make sense of generative algorithms and outcomes. We have yet to understand what user interface technologies will enable humans to control, and more generally to interact with these powerful capabilities. These human-like capabilities put into question our current paradigms for mixed initiative user interfaces. Further, the unpredictability of “creative” algorithms raises new questions about how, when, and how much control humans may wish to share with these algorithms. Finally, it is not clear what kinds of collaboration patterns will emerge when creative humans and creative technologies work together.

In this one-day workshop, we will convene the interdisciplinary research domain of generative AI and HCI. Participation in this invitational workshop is open to seasoned scholars and early career researchers from diverse disciplines. We solicit descriptions of completed projects, works-in-progress, and provocations. Together we will develop theories and practices in this intriguing new domain.

## Topics

Because of the far-reaching implications of Generative AI, we propose the following list of non-exhaustive, thematic questions to guide our discussions at the workshop:

- What is generative AI and how can we leverage diverse definitions of it? Does generative AI go beyond intelligent interaction? What distinguishes generative AI?
- How do you design in this space? What design patterns do we need to think about? How does uncertainty play into this and how to we help people set expectations to designing with AI?
- Do generative AI algorithms contribute needed serendipity to the design process—or simply randomness—or worse, chaos?
- Is presenting AI as a desirable and “objective” method appropriate for generative AI?

We encourage people to write and answer their own questions as well. We hope that the workshop leads to new ways-of-thinking. These themes can be addressed within the following topics:

- The emerging capabilities of generative AI.
- Generative AI existence in different domains including (but not limited to) images, music, text, design, and motion.
- The role of generative AI in assisting, replacing, and regimenting human work.
- Human-AI collaboration and co-creative systems.
- Ethical issues including misuses and abuses, provenance, copyright, bias, and diversity.
- The uncanny valley in Human-AI interactions.

As above, we encourage people to add new topics and domains. -->

Fooling Justin Bieber into picking a fight with Tom Cruise, completing Beethoven’s unfinished "SymphonyNo. 10", and developing fake faces for stock photography are some of the results that Artificial Intelligence(AI) systems have recently brought to the world. What all of these examples have in common is that the AI does notsimply categorize data and interpret text as determined by models, but instead it creates something new. This movesthe purpose of AI systems from problem solving to problem finding. In this workshop we focus on various aspects of Generative AI (GenAI) and its interactions with humans, including the design of systems based on GenAI, ethical issuesrelated to their design and use, and useful patterns for collaboration between humans and GenAI in different domains

## Call for Participation
Our workshop is open to diverse interpretations of interactive GenAI characterized by the AI systems abilities tomake new things, learn new things and foster serendipity and emergence. We are interested in several dimensionsof GenAI, including mixed initiative, human–computer collaboration, or human–computer competition, with themain focus on interaction between humans and GenAI agents. We welcome researchers from various disciplines,inviting researchers from different creative domains including, but not limited to art, images, music, text, style transfer,text-to-image, programming, architecture, design, fashion and movement.


## Organizers
**Lydia B. Chilton** is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Columbia University. She is an early pioneer in decomposing complex tasks so that crowds and computers can solve them together. Her current research is in computational design - how computation and AI can help people with design, innovation and creative problem solving. Applications include: conveying a message within an image for journalism and advertising, developing technology for public libraries, improving risk communication during hurricanes, and helping scientists explain their work on Twitter.
 
**Anna Kantosalo** is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Helsinki. The focus of her research is Human--Computer Co-Creativity and she is defining models and methods for building and describing systems in which humans and autonomous creative agents can work together. She has chaired the Future of Co-Creative Systems workshop adjoined with the International Conference on Computational Creativity twice.
 
**Charles Martin** is a Lecturer in Computer Science at the Australian National University. Charles works at the intersection of music, AI/ML and HCI. He studies how humans can interact creatively with intelligent computing systems and how such systems might fit in the real world. Charles has organised multiple generative-AI-focused workshops at the New Interfaces for Musical Expression conference.
 
**Michael Muller** is a Research Scientist at IBM Research in Cambridge MA USA. With colleagues, he has analyzed how domain experts make use of generative AI outcomes, and how humans intervene between "the data" and "the model" as aspects of responsible and accountable data science work. He has co-organized workshops on human centered data science at CHI, CSCW, and GROUP conferences, and a workshop on human centered AI at a NeurIPS conference.

This information is for reviewers, authors, and other participants at GenAICHI.

CHI Workshops have a very short review timeframe with around 2 weeks from the common submission deadline to the announcement of decisions. There is about a 7-day span available to read papers and write reviews.

## A few notes

- Papers for GenAICHI are 4 pages in single-column ACM format with additional pages available for references.
- Papers may or may not be anonymous - we are only expecting single-blind reviewing (reviewer is anonymous from authors)
- Each paper must have two reviews before we make an acceptance decision
- Some papers may receive meta-reviews that summarise reviews or provide further information
- Expected Topics and Themes can be found on the [main workshop page]({% link README.md %}).
- As the papers are short, we expect reviews to also be quite short. It should not take long to write a review for each workshop paper.

## Review Instructions

Reviews should include:

- A 1-sentence summary of the submission
- Indication of how the submission is aligned with the [workshop Topics and Themes]({% link README.md %})
- Indication of whether the submission is complete, in the correct format, and reasonably comprehensible.
- Indication of the potential of the submission to initiate interesting discussion at the workshop.
- Whether the submission has any major flaws or misunderstandings indicating that it not ready for discussion at a workshop.

Reviews that address these questions clearly and succinctly will be most useful in making acceptance decisions within the very short timeframes for CHI workshop reviewing.

## Meta-Review Instructions

Meta-reviews are not guaranteed for all papers. Where a meta-review is included it will:

- summarise the reviews
- add any further information that is necessary for making an acceptance decision
- provide reasoning for an acceptance decision both in terms of the reviews and extra information provided by the meta-reviewer
